# Kibana 

Kibana is an open-source data visualization and exploration tool that is part of the Elastic Stack, which also includes Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Beats. Kibana is specifically designed to work alongside Elasticsearch to help users visualize and analyze their data stored in Elasticsearch in real-time.

Key features of Kibana include:

- Data Visualization: Kibana provides a wide range of visualization options, such as bar charts, line charts, pie charts, maps, and more. Users can create interactive and customizable visualizations to represent their data in meaningful ways.

- Dashboard Creation: Kibana allows you to build interactive dashboards by combining different visualizations into a single view. Dashboards can help users monitor and analyze various aspects of their data in real-time.

- Search and Exploration: Kibana offers a powerful search and querying interface that enables users to explore their data and perform ad-hoc searches across indexed fields. This is particularly useful for log and event data analysis.

- Index Pattern Management: Kibana provides tools to manage and define index patterns, which specify how data in Elasticsearch is mapped to fields for search and visualization.

- Time-Series Data Analysis: Kibana is well-suited for analyzing time-series data, making it a popular choice for monitoring and observability use cases.

- Machine Learning Integration: Kibana integrates with Elasticsearch's machine learning features to help detect anomalies, forecast trends, and perform other advanced analyses.

- Alerting: Kibana also offers alerting capabilities, allowing users to set up alerts based on specific conditions in their data and receive notifications when those conditions are met.

- User Authentication and Access Control: Kibana provides features for user authentication, access control, and role-based permissions, ensuring that different users have appropriate levels of access to data and features.

# Installation

```
docker network create elastic

docker run --name kibana --network elastic -p 5601:5601 -d docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:<version>

```

Once the container is running, you can access Kibana by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:5601.

If you're running Docker on a remote server or using a different port, replace localhost and 5601 with the appropriate hostname and port.
